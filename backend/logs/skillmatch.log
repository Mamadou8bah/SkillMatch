From hobbyists to multinational corporations, teams of every size use Tailscale each day to protect their networks, share access to internal tools, and more. We&#8217;re building a future for the Internet that&#8217;s easy, sensible, and safe, like it used to be.

This role requires shipping consistently, with an expectation of producing high-quality videos on a regular, fast-paced cadence.</p><p>This is a hands-on, on-camera role. You should be comfortable explaining nuanced technical concepts directly to developers, writing your own demos or examples where appropriate, and maintaining a calm, credible presence that builds trust over time. Coding experience is desirable and familiarity with developer tooling is essential.</p><p>Initially, you’ll step into our established YouTube presence as part of our Developer Relations team, and over time, you’ll help refine and evolve Tailscale’s video strategy, formats, and voice.
